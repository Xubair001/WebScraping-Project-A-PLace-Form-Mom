1456368,Jackie,4.0,Recommended ,"My communication with the schedulers has been excellent, with a few glitches that were quickly corrected. When selecting a company, I would ask how caretakers are vetted and compensated to gain an idea of the kinds of candidates they attract. Although 1 or 2 of the caretakers, the younger ones, did not work out for us-too much time on their phones, not enough personal engagement with my husband who is the patient- most have been friendly, helpful and cooperative.  Several are excellent in every way, and have become regulars.  Home health care is very expensive, much more than assisted living, and is not covered by Medicare, except for actual medical services, but Right at Home assures me they will provide a statement outlining the tax deductions allowable. If you can afford it, home health care is far preferable to an assisted living facility.  These are understaffed and poorly regulated and patients' experiences in most of them, according to published reports, is not what anyone would want for a loved one. Overall, ROH has been a godsend for my husband and for me. They are a national franchise. I would recommend them in the Charleston, SC area and hopefully elsewhere.

They hardly have any fun activities to do.  They always make necklaces and bracelets to sell so that Brookdale can get money.  For Christmas, they haven't done anything.  You would think that they would make gingerbread houses at least.
They have Happy Hour and they will pass out a piece of candy or a sliver of cake.  They always play trivia games and never anything else.  My mom hates Trivia so it isn't fun for her. They are so cheap!
They never play fun music or have bands.  They will hire a violinist or solo musician and that is it.

1248510,Mrs X,0.5,Very poor facility based on experience,"Very disappointed in this ALF. Mom lived here for 2 years. It was good when there were few residents, however as management, chef & employees left and it became more populated, care was sacrificed to a great extent. The place began to smell as residents were left in soiled clothes, laundry was done on a “quick wash” leaving it smelly and still soiled. Food was the equivalent to a truck stop, with breakfast being the only satisfactory meal. Lunch & dinner were heavy, dry pasta, meat, potatoes & bread with a few soggy vegetables. Fruit, when available was canned peaches, pears or fruit cocktail. It was not a menu that the elderly would choose, had they the ability to do so. There are also functional obsolescences throughout the facility. The bathrooms are so small it is nearly impossible to accommodate a wheelchair. There is no protection from weather when taking a resident from the memory care facility and no automatic doors that stay open while maneuvering a wheelchair. The dining area is too small to accommodate full residency so some residents are put alone in common areas to eat. The staff quickly puts residents in their rooms to “nap” even if they don’t “nap” after lunch, I assume in an effort to keep the common area uncrowded. There are just too many negative issues to address. Management is confrontational and quick to threaten expulsion hen issues are raised.

1295174,Tom Allen,5.0,Sunrise Continues to Earn My Respect,"After a year at Sunrise, for both of our 91 and 92 year-old grandmothers, we still have great things to say about Sunrise and their staff. One grandmother is reasonably independent and can take care of her basic daily needs (with a lot of help from the Sunrise care team). While the other requires additional care because of her mobility and memory challenges. Both have been able to successfully integrate into the Sunrise community, make interesting friendships, participate in most of the activities, and enjoy the weekly outings (parks, museums, casino, restaurants, beach and mountains). They have come to realize that simple exercise, a great diet, and social interactions are key to creating a happier life-style. One noticeable change is their focus on what they are going to do today, as opposed to what they can no longer do, i.e. driving. 
We get a lot of questions about what it is like at Sunrise now that over a year has passed and we have had an opportunity to experience their services and community. Here are key examples of what we have experienced:
•	Their medical team quickly diagnosed an upper respiratory infection that was causing her blood pressure to drop to unsafe levels and rushed her to the ER. The were completely on top of the situation, monitoring her vitals every day and took decisive action. 
•	Every time we visit Sunrise we are greeted by name. Why is this important – the staff takes the time to get to know us and how they can better meet our needs and concerns. Sunrise has had very little staff turnover, so it is much easier to build a relationship with the staff that is used to communicate what is going on with the grandmothers each week.
•	We still receive the monthly status calls from the care director updating us on the care they are providing and how well the grandmothers are doing – socially, physically, mentally. At every opportunity they seek our input – how are we doing? How can we improve? 
•	Prior to coming to Sunrise one grandmother lived at another local assisted living facility for over a year. During that time, we had nothing but monthly issues with the billing. We were constantly over billed by $100-$1,000 each month. It took hours of my time each month to correct their mistakes. At Sunrise we have had no billing errors. They know what they are doing, and the support staff is competent.
•	So, what don’t we like? Honestly, I haven’t found any issue that impacts the care my mother is receiving. Sunrise has earned my respect.

1282885,Don,5.0,So much more than brick and mortar!,"
Approximately six months ago, I was in a situation of having to find a memory care community for my wife.  My requirements were high. Three or four days into my search and after having visited way too many communities, my son and I were visiting Westbrook Senior Living in Streamwood.  During our visit, we were fortunate to have met the Director of the Memory Care Unit, whom we talked with at great length. And we met many members of the staff, and just happened to have an unexpected “interview” with the daughter of a resident of the community who was there to pick up her Mom for an outing. My question for the daughter was brief and to the point, “How would you describe your experience at Westbrook?” Her response was a short five word sentence which said it all, “The staff here is amazing!”

After experiencing Westbrook for six months, I fully agree with the daughter's five word review. An example of this is easily illustrated by the fact one of the caregivers who we interacted with as my daughter, son, and I were setting up my wife's room, asked what day my wife was coming into Westbrook?  When we told her, she said that was her day off, but she would come in that morning because she wanted to meet my wife, and she did. 

Over the past months, I have experienced and observed much within the memory care unit. I am impressed with the Caregivers philosophy of family. Several of the staff have said to me they consider  those in memory care as family, and it is evident. One day as I was leaving, a Caregiver was walking in with a huge birthday cake she had purchased for all to enjoy in celebration of a resident's birthday. I have received calls from the Director keeping me informed on the transition progress of my wife. I have witnessed many times, staff sitting with residents on the benches in the halls, just talking and keeping them company. I have witnessed  the Director playing cards in the early evening with a new resident helping in the transition process. I have seen and heard laughter many, many times among staff and residents. It is unusual to not see a smile on the faces of staff. It is evident the staff enjoys what they are doing, and the residents enjoy the staff.

The brick and mortar of this approximately three to four year old facility is outstanding.  It is extremely clean, attractive, well maintained, comfortable, has many amenities, etc. One would hope that is true of any place that someone calls home, and it certainly is here at Westbrook.  But in my opinion, the staff is what makes a community like this exceptional.  Echoing the response of the daughter I just happened to meet during our initial visit to Westbrook, “The staff here is amazing!'

I would recommend you speak directly with the director about the care that your loved one needs.  The sales director fed us a line of BS that turned out to not be enforceable by the staff.  And they had a big attitude about how little they were actually caring for my mother.  She does wander, and they could not keep her secure because the supposed ""secure"" entrances and exits were all open due to renovations.  I was promised in my preliminary meetings with the Sales Mgr. that this would not be a problem.  My mom was there less than a week when I got the call that I had to get there as soon as possible to move her out.  The temperature in the building is very inconsistent.  The food seems ok, the water fowl lake is very nice, but the communication between departments sucks.  They put my sister and I in a very difficult position, I will NOT recommend them to ANYONE.  Too bad, as it is probably going to be a very nice looking place after the renovations are done.

1483974,Rose C,5.0,I'm happy with my choice,"They are very knowledgeable and helpful and will do their best to get a room/ apartment ready for you.... the staff is very friendly and will do whatever it takes to make your days as comfortable as possible.  There is a bus for use to go to doctor appts,  food Lion and Walmart...   there is a very dependable, qualified driver to run you back and forth... meals are prepared  three times a day and served in the dining room along with coffee, juices,  tea , milk and lemonade at mealtime. There is always a main meal, an alternate, a heart-healthy, a sandwich and chef salads and fruit plates with cottage cheese.   Lunches come with your choice of the salad of the day, which is smaller , the side salad has lettuces , cherry tomato and cucumber plus additional toppings and dressings. There's usually a homemade yeast roll every day with lunch and a dessert. At dinner,  meals are usually
 lighter since the noon meal is huge!!! Usually soup and sandwich or salad . The dessert cart comes around at the end of dinner with a variety of ice creams, cakes, puddings, fresh fruit cups and other treats.  Lately our meals have not been that great.  We can't seem to keep a cook and have to keep re-hiring a night chef. Sometimes the meals run out before everyone is served or the servers don't all come in and then it takes forever to get your meal .  Lunch is an hour and a half long , usually.  Breakfast does have a variety of cold and hot cereals, fruits, eggs, toasts or English muffins, meats several times a week but breakfast meat is not served every day... there is an Activity room where residents go to play games, WII bowling, art class , bingo and a soft -serve ice cream machine. There is ice cream in it all day, every day, which many people love ... there is always
 entertainment for us, square-dancers, singers, children from the local  churches sing songs and provide entertainment .... other activities are planned during the week that include trips to museums, parks and lakes for picnic lunches, etc., concerts, dairy farms for fresh ice cream and others. It's mostly a lot of fun here and new friends galore!   The worst part of it is the weight  you can gain from all these wonderful meals. I have found you cannot eat the yeast roll every day and no dessert if you eat the yeast roll.... which brings me to the GYM. There's an exercise class every day at 9:00 and 3:000 plus fully loaded gym with different exercise equipment for your use. There's a fully stocked library plus lots of jig  saw puzzles to do. The grounds are beautifully kept with flowers and roses and trees! There is a housekeeping staff to change your sheets and clean your private
 bathroom every week. They vacuum the carpets and sweep floors. Overall, it's been a great experience living here! I have really enjoyed it and there are two medical offices in the building if you need therapy or special help getting ready for bed . Since this is an independent living facility here, you should be able to do things for  yourself. But if you need help, there is Com-for-care to help with bathing and dressing or getting medicines. Legacy helps provide therapy if need be.  You can have your own vehicle, too, with free parking .  This building is located near  shopping malls, stores, restraunts and a variety of other things like museums and other places of interest.

My daddy's closet was routinely replenished with other resident's clothing. What was put away in drawers was balled up & crammed in the drawers & socks lost & mismatched with other resident's socks. My daddy was routinely restrained in his wheel chair behind the table in the activity room and china cabinet. My daddy was not changed regularly & was NEVER turned him at night & NEVER repositioned in his wheelchair. Within 2 months  my father had a pressure wound that went septic. That wound (gaping, puss-filled, rotting sore took my father's life.
I wouldn't recommend The Pearl to ANYONE- EVER! It is beautiful facility, aestetically. The food was good.  The caretakers are severely underpaid. And I do not think they are trained to work on this level of care.

When she first got their I went to some loud music thing, it was way too loud and she got kind of rattled. She kind of likes it quiet and adult like so when they throw a party it's not her thing. 3/4 of that place is independent living and 1/4 is enhanced care so that's what makes it do able.

1107203,Laura,5.0,Forever home,"My mother and father moved into Summit Hills into an independent apartment June of 2018. We had visited other senior communities and found Summit Hills to offer the best housing, social, and value for our money. My father was starting to show heavy signs of Alzheimer’s and the fact that is was a gated community made my mother and I feel more secure if he wondered outside alone. The community has beautiful interior design, constant activities and delicious dining fare. My family came to eat in the dining room many times. In February of 2020 we moved my father into the Memory Care unit there. It was hard to turn over a parent to people I did not know but he was too much for my mother to handle at 82 years old. I visited my dad many times a week and had wonderful walks around the campus. I got to know the caregivers and they my dad. After only six weeks of him being there, Corona-19 virus locked the care services building down to stop the spread. I was unable to see him until [date removed] when we could start window visits. The caregivers who brought him to see me shared wonderful moments they had with him that mad me smile. During this horrible time of lockdown, the caregivers gave more of themselves than ever, filling in as true family when we could not be together to hug or walk together. Seven weeks ago, my mother had a stroke and was taken to the hospital, unable to use her right side. We were able to have her some back to Summit Hills and use their Rehab services and stay in the Skilled Nursing area. It was so much easier for me to be able to check on their apartment, get mail, and visit with both parents at the same location. My father succumbed to his disease two weeks ago. Everyone I passed as I walked through the halls with my mother had a kind word about my dad. The staff has been so accommodating and thoughtful on our families’ needs during this time or mourning.

Being understaffed is definitely not gonna make it happen besides staff don't get much support from immediate supervisors (nurses) and are overloaded with and held accountable for responsibilities nurses should be completing themselves along with A.L. director. Not to mention them, being part of the gossip as well as the Executive Director.

Waited for 45 minutes until the Executive Director who didn't seem happy that she had to tour us, toured us.  She was in a rush during our tour, we asked about seeing the memory living and the Executive Director said that we need an advance appointment before they let us see that part of the community.  (Which we had, and express that to the Executive Director).  Which didn't make any sense, we also notice that a lot of nursing staff around the station on their cell phones and cursing during our tour.  Executive Director addressed this with the nursing staff, but when we left the nursing station and looked back at the station, 2 of the nurses were giving the Executive Director the middle finger.  If that is how they act towards their boss, I can't image what they would do with my Mom in this community.

The driver has befriended my dad and always makes sure he has everything he needs whether it's a trip to the doctor, to Walmart or whenever he and his friends want to go out to a restaurant (as long as it's scheduled in advance if course).

My mother has tried to get in twice, living well below her means for 3 months just to qualify, waiting for an approval.  She filled out the application, received a move in date and moved out of her current apartment (TWICE) to move into these apartments.  She put down a $300 holding fee (TWICE), intending to move in, with a move in date, which kept getting changed.  She has lost that holding fee both times, since it is non refundable.  That is $600 and for a senior looking to move into senior housing to save money, this is a huge burden on her.  She was under the impression that she was approved to move in both times, as both times she had a move in date.  Within days of supposedly moving into SHAG, she was notified that she did not meet the income limit, which they will not get back to her to tell her how they arrived at this conclusion.  She is now forced to look for another apartment, while living with a friend.  SHAG has made her practically homeless for 3 months...twice.

Burr Ridge helped to outline the options for both assisted living, as well as the Memory Care options we may need to tap into going forward. We appreciated the transparency in both the base costs and costs at additional care levels. 

The move to Burr Ridge Senior Living was completed successfully in a matter of weeks. We have been happy with how friendly the staff has been and responsive to working with our folks to help them feel at home and answer any questions and implement desired changes.  Quite a bit is included in the base cost that was not at the other facility related to maintaining and improving their health. In the month that they've been there, our folks are both healthier and happier, with a care plan to keep them on this path, regardless of the health issues that may be coming in the future. It is a very vibrant community!

We would like to express our deep appreciation and gratitude for the care [name removed]  receives and her living community at Legacy Pointe/ Independence Village. [name removed]  Was moved into long-term care shortly before the beginning of covid-19 pandemic. We cannot even begin to imagine the struggles this pandemic has presented to the staff and management of the care facility and empathize with the additional stress it must cause for employees and their care of the residents. As difficult as it is to not be able to see or touch a loved one in your care, we understand your need to keep the environment clean and safe for all. We feel [name removed]  and us, her family, have been treated with kindness and compassion through this difficult time. The staff has done a commendable job in dealing with the issues caused by isolation and helping to develop appropriate ways for us to communicate with our loved one through secure outside visits, through Windows, behind plexiglass walls, and through the use of Technology. By giving direct access to her advocate, [name removed], we are able to stay connected with the facility and feel involved in [name removed]’s daily care.  it has been a huge blessing and comfort for us! We have many friends and contacts in various care facilities around the area and feel blessed to have [name removed]  in Legacy Point / Independence Village.

We are appreciative of everyone at Legacy but would like to take this opportunity to personally thank a few staff members who take special care of [name removed] we specifically appreciate [names removed]. since we, her biological family, aren't able to care for [name removed]  directly, we want to thank them for their kindness and compassion towards her. They not only do their jobs well, but they have fun and treat [name removed]  with respect. Most importantly, I would like to give an incredibly special shout out to [name removed].  he has gone above and beyond to connect us through regular Communications, updates, sending pictures, and text messages, as well as answering our questions and dealing with any concerns or medical issues. His kindness and Care is second to none! He was wonderful to work with prior to the pandemic and he has been invaluable to us over the past few months. We hope you know and appreciate this gem on your stuff as much as we do!

The sliding glass door did not have a key and they had no intentions of making one. I was told not to worry about locking it when I go out because the community was safe. They indicated that the sliding glass door was going to be replaced, but they made no attempt to do so until I left. It's also important to know that if rent is missed, arrangements can be made but have to made by a certain date or there would be an automatic eviction. Many other residents have been evicted and have left on their own because of that issue or because of the fact that maintenance was slow and that the facility was outdated and did not warrant the amount of the rent. They made it very easy to move in, but after moving in, things changed over time, especially with new management.

Another problem with this place is they seem to want to isolate residents from friends and family. This is not good for elderly people. The employees here have no problem scaring the residents with eviction if they don't do what say...even if it is wrong.

1106148,Laura R Yanne,5.0,I only wish we'd moved to Equinox Terrace first! ,"I cannot say enough good things about Equinox Terrace. I brought my mother to Vermont from Massachusetts, and she was at another facility for 10 months. I was displeased (that is an understatement!) with the level of care she was receiving there, and it was obvious that my mother was declining because of lack of stimulation and lack of understanding, so I moved her to Equinox Terrace. Thank goodness I did!  What an incredible difference--the skill level of the staff, the quality of every aspect of the place was superior. The executive director recognized my dedication to my mother, who was in hospice care, and permitted me to become a designated caregiver. I will forever be grateful for this time (six weeks before she died), for the ability to care for her, to be understood. This was of inestimable importance, and I am so very, very thankful! The dining experience was a pleasure, the residents were happy (such a change from the dull, doomed atmosphere at the other place, even though the physical building was pleasant enough); the staff was cheerful and helpful. The food was truly top notch, and my mother's vegetarian diet was accommodated. The executive director is brilliant at her job--everything hums along, she updates family members with emails (so important in this time of covid!), maintains an events schedule so residents have something to look forward to... she is capable and responsive, and ensures that the staff is likewise. She has meetings where residents can air their wishes and preferences. It is a place where people are living, not just waiting to shuffle off. I am profoundly thankful for Equinox Terrace, and I will always treasure my mother's and my last weeks together, made possible because of [name removed] and what she's done at ET.

She was placed on hospice, and at the recommendation of her Nurse Practitioner, we moved her to Com For Care.  Our family was flabbergasted at the amount of personal care they provided for an extremely reasonable price when compared to the cost at University Place.  All the meals I saw were prepared with fresh, not canned ingredients and smelled delicious. She was attended to night and day and always with a kind and caring attitude. It was evident that everyone truly cared. We had a camera in her room, with the owner's permission, so that we could keep a close eye on my mother since she had fallen before and could see that someone checked on her regularly during the night encouraging her to eat and drink and attending to any needs. They tried everything to encourage her to eat including pureeing food, providing ice cream, making milk shakes and smoothies, spoon feeding her, and everything else we and they could think of, but to no avail as my mother only lived a few more weeks. When she died, we were notified immediately. As her death approached, they spoke with each family member when they visited to help them come to accept that she was dying and that they were there to help in any way they could. When she died, they were in no rush to empty her room for the next person as many places are and only charged us for the time my mother was alive, not the entire last month. I wholeheartedly recommend [name removed] and Com For Care. I believe that they will provide unrivaled care for your loved ones.

Matt with Avalon spoke with me at length before we actually met to tour. During our conversation, he really honed into where my mom was at in the disease process. He toured us in the 3 residential care homes that he thought would be the best fit for mom. At each home, we were greeted with smiles and it just felt like home. What was most impressive was watching the staff interacting with the folks there. There was no desk for staff to be perched behind. The staff were very tuned into the residents. It was also interesting to learn that much of the staff had been there for a long time. That really spoke to me and my wife. You don't see that often. You could just tell that the staff really loved the residents there. They each had their rooms decorated with their own belongings.

Nancy, Lisa, Aba (sic?), and Teri who run the front office are very caring people.  When I need advice on a particular situation, they have the answers.  The numerous staff (will not name them all) are all excellent.  They (Arden Cts.) do a good job of retention of employees.  That is very important to me.  My Dad (resident) likes the usual caretakers to keep feeling like there is continuity in his daily activities.

Activities are where this place shines.  Jane and Renee (sic?) run an excellent activity center.  They always have something going on for the residents.

I am there every day, and see the great job they do.  The food here is better than any memory care unit I have been to.  That would be about four different places in the same area.  Keith, the main cook  loves his job, and you can tell by the quality of food he servers.  They often have family nights, which is a big  party.  We recently had a Thanksgiving meal/party that was excellent!!!  I would recommend this place to anyone who is suffering from the HELL know as dementia.  Truly a God send.

My family has to go in every day just to make sure that she gets the proper care.  That should not be going on especially with as much as we pay them.  The reason why I came here was because I was very impressed with the community and the staff.  I have since seen differently.  The food is okay at least better than hospital food. The fish that they served was gross and freezer burned.  I have even saw residents in the hall that needed to be changed and I had to tell a aide to do so.,2016-11-15T17:10:13.000Z,Memory Care,https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/brookdale-virginia-beach-79526,Brookdale Virginia Beach,"937 Diamond Springs Road, Virginia Beach, VA 23455",virginia-beach,virginia,23455,nursing-homes

The floor nurses can't answer questions about the resident.  The standard answer is ""I don't know"".  They are not tuned in to the residents needs.  I asked then to do a UTI test for my family member as she was getting disoriented and upset.  It took them 9 days to get the result back and she did have a UTI.  Another time it took 6 days to get a result back and again it was positive.  She missed a lot of meals, her alarm pendant went missing for more than 14 hours and she was not able to call for help if she needed it.  Very disappointed in it.  We moved her to another Assisted Living and she is doing very well.

Edina Park has been there forever. I've lived in Bloomington for 49 years and it seems like it's been there as long. The building is very tall and very different from what's around it. It's quite an old building but it doesn't look old - they've kept it up over the years and they're remodeling it now. There is a swimming pool and a daily activity program posted in the entry way. They have a bus service. It's really quite close to a large mall and they take you to your doctors appointments.

The provide meals. I'm renting a one bedroom and a den and 48 meals a month. You can buy more meals and they have people that will do your laundry and things for a fee.

1113513,Anonymous,5.0,Best rehab in Indy!,"My 84 year old mother recently stayed at the Forum for therapy after a difficult bout with pneumonia.  She was so weak she could not even stand alone, we were afraid she would never be able to return home alone again to the house she has lived in and loved for 47 years.
A representative from the Forum came to the hospital to meet with us and explain all of her options and what to expect, she told us how my mothers medicare and supplemental insurance worked and even told us how much she would have to pay each day after her insurance coverage ran out. She spent over an hour with us answering all of our questions and even gave us her personal cell phone number in case we thought of any other questions and told us to call her night or day if we had any problems.
Well we never had to call her because my mothers care while there was far beyond what we could have ever expected.  The nurses and aides were so friendly and genuinely seemed to care about her and made an effort to go out of their way to take care of her.  Her therapist were very diligent and patient with her and not only got her back to where she was before the pneumonia but helped her get equipment for home to make life easier and keep her safe.

The sense of community and caring is felt throughout the organization.  When my parents first looked at Birch Hill as their potential home 7 years ago my Dad said ""now this is a place where I can see us living""...and he immediately jumped right into the activities.  After a few years living independently, my Mom needed to move to assisted living.  It was a very tough decision, but our entire family was fully supported by management, clinical staff and care givers throughout the process.

Obviously an organization of this kind must operate like a business to stay viable, but at Birch Hill that has not taken away from the caring experienced by my parents, siblings and me. Every time I leave from a visit I am reminded of how fortunate we are to have found a place where my parents are safely cared for and enjoying their golden years.

1163868,annon,2.0,New owners are horrific,"This is an independent living facilities so no care services provided. No activities are provided unless initiated by the residents. Management is not friendly and would prefer not to interact with us. Ever.

This would have been 4 star prior to January 2020 when the facility was sold. The new owners and their managers are horrific. There is almost no communication of changes that affect us, nearly everything we do get is written in a threatening way, and we are treated like 5 year old inmates.

We received a 20 page, single spaced 10 point type, written in paragraphs of things we couldn't do. 

They do not post information letting us know what is going on, for example, they are closing the laundry room except between 9 and 4:30 M-F  - we are just faced with a locked door. For two days, for reasons unknown, mail was no longer going to be delivered to our mailboxes and we were to go to the post office to get it. No notice was posted. We found out by word of mouth.

They do not process paperwork in a timely manner and only give you last minute notice of things you need to do (for example the night before it is due they place it on your door and don't even knock). 

They are not good about answering the phone, you are not allowed to go to the office to talk to them. Their notices say call or email but they do not include the the email address on the notice.

They don't give receipts for rent and have lost more than one person's rent check. They then give out notices you have to be out in 10 days (state law says you have to be taken to court and you have 30 days to pay the rent before they can do that) and they just put it on your door. To my knowledge (eg people talking about it) all lost rent checks have eventually been found, but they are not careful. 

They don't follow up on what they say they will do without repeated reminders - which mostly can only be done if you happen to see them in the lobby and then they often don't make eye contact, pretend they don't hear you or tell you that you can't ask a question. They rarely answer emails even if you are asking questions. You are to tell personal information to the resident who mans the lobby desk for her to pass on. 

They will inspect your apt 4x a year and the rules say if you fail inspection (for example a bit of dust on top of the fridge, or have too much stuff, too many collectables on shelves, etc.) you can be evicted per their rules. They made people take down door wreathes... And the list goes on and on. 

When they give out recertification notices they don't even bother to proof read them.  A couple people had one that said the manager was calling each of those people at the same time. While I haven't gone through recertification yet, people who have said they aren't given the forms you are supposed to fill out, they only take a small amount of info verbally and all of them that I have heard complaining said their rent was raised significantly even though circumstances haven't changed. Medical expenses, including medications are supposed to be subtracted from one's gross income/amount of money you get a month and apparently they aren't even asking about that. It is clear they don't know all the HUD rules for 62 and older/disability HUD. 

Although the building is old with serious foundation problems, the apartments aren't all that bad (although they are small - 2 rooms and about 525sf). The location is convenient, although it is not all that safe to walk around outside of the parking lot after dark. 

It is supposed to be a smoke free building and smoking, even in your apartment (supposed to smoke outside, I guess standing in the rain), but the halls frequently smell like cigarette smoke and weed. I am tired of the stink and I wish they'd spend the time to enforce those rules rather than yap about more minor things.

I could go on and on... The upshot is that it is better than being homeless, but under the current management, if you have another choice I'd not move here. Many people have left or are looking to leave (and are on waiting lists to get in elsewhere) due to the new management.

1129995,Daughter,2.5,Mixed Experience,"We were living that nursing home nightmare. I didn't really have a life anymore because I felt like I had to be there all the time to make sure she was taken care of. To be totally honest, in general, I would say if you compare it to other nursing homes, it wasn't a bad place. Some of the nurses and LPN's there were fabulous, but not all of them. There was one on the later shift that was especially gruff with my mother. Some were more attentive. Sometimes she had to wait 30 minutes for help, but the bottom line is that they are understaffed. When you interview, they tell you you have X number of LPN's and CNA's but it doesn't always pan out that way. Those women are really scrambling and working hard trying to take care of everybody but there's more work than they can do. The rehab staff we loved. It wasn't bad care, but the other thing is, she was in the rehab the whole time she was there, not long term care. I don't know what would have happened once she was expected to be there permanently. There was an incident that never got resolution that confirmed that we made the right decision to pull her out. There was a day that they got her up and took her to rehab and had her sit up for awhile. Her roommate wasn't there so she was by herself in the room. My cousin got there after 4 and my mother was still sitting up; she had been left in the chair all day long. They had the wheelchair locked so she couldn't wheel it out into the hall, and she couldn't reach her cord to get help. She wasn't on her feeding tube and hadn't be changed. We talked to the director about it and he said he would get back but we never got any answer or response or follow up. To me warrants a phone call. Most of the girls were pretty nice people, but when shift changed around 9 we would see six CNA's all sitting in the lobby. She was supposed to get her meds by 7 and sometimes it would be 8:30 or 9. At the time she was there her mind was totally sound and out there you would have everyone - people screaming, or in a vegetative state. There was no area for people of sound minds to be on their own. She wouldn't come out of her room because she didn't want to be around all those people, but I guess they can't help that kind of situation.

1413234,LF,3.0,Convenient location for Mom but problems with billing LTC insurance.,"When we moved our mom into Brookdale, it wasn't organized.  The director, head of nursing and activities director did meet her in the next few days.  But the executive chef actually showed us around the building upon move in.  I explained we're paying through long term care benefits before we made the commitment to move my mother to Brookdale.  The sales director and executive director both said they work with and bill LTC providers.  Having invested a great deal of time contacting the LTC provider and many e-mails and phone calls to the executive director, the December and January invoices were faxed mid-late February.  I was told that was unusual and things would go smoothly from then on.  As of today, the LTC provider has not received my mom's February invoice.  Again, I've made many calls and sent numerous e-mails requesting the invoice/claim form be faxed which Brookdale has to sign off on every month.

1285050,Anonymous,1.0,Horrid Place! Don't go here!,"DO NOT go here!!! The weekend care taker was so bad that if I could file a report on her with the State, I would. Anyway, our mother was in bad shape and the owner told us that they could take care of her until end of life. She was there for a month and he calls us and tells us that she's exceeded their care and we have to move her. They let us know that the sooner the better and that they just can't do it even though they were told AHEAD of time that she was a FULL ASSIST patient and would need help in going to the bathroom. 

This weekend caretaker (Fri-Sun) would throw her into the bed with the help of another care taker and tell her, ""Don't bother turning on your call light as I won't answer it!"" So, if our mother needed to go to the bathroom she'd have to lie in it for the entire night as the care taker would refuse to change her. By morning this would be unacceptable as you can imagine!! An adult depends can only hold so much. Plus, the weekend care taker didn't seem to care that our mother had loose screws in her back that was causing her pain and by throwing her into bed was also causing the screws to move all over and jarring her back. The care taker would get mad if the plates weren't put back on the table correctly - who cares if it's not set right - if someone wanted to use it during the day. It was all for show anyway! The weekend care taker was always on the phone doing her own thing and never doing anything that she should have been doing and was listening to her music or talking to her family on the phone. Forget that there's people that need to be taken care of there. 

The only good care taker was the weekly one who was the manager of the place. She made sure the people there received the proper care and really looked after the people. That's the only good thing there. One person who was good to the people. That was it. Other than that nothing else. 

The owner wouldn't respond back after numerous attempts of contacting them. They would run of out supplies multiple times during the week and he would be very insistent on them hand washing the dishes instead of using the dishwasher as he didn't want to use up the extra water and electricity.

She probably spent some of her best years here.  The staff fell in love with her and visa versa. 

I didn't have to worry about her at all, the nurses had my cell and kept me updated.  She was also a block away so I saw her several times a month. But that's because I wanted too see her, not because I was concerned about her... at all.  She was SO happy.  I am an RN, so I would know if she isn't being treated properly.  The facility provided daily activities for her, painting, movies in their theater, games...  She was treated exactly the way that you would want your family member to treated.

My daughter is a licensed social worker who says that VOTP is the best facility in the state of Arkansas. I fully believe that after my mothers stay there for the last 3 years.  I have nothing but the best things to say about the entire facility.  We never had a bad experience.

I have not had any complainants only that there was a ant problem in my moms bathroom but they took care of it right away. 

Promenda has plenty of activities but my mom doesn't care to partake in it. They have sing along, current events reading and she is 90 and says ""I don't want to hear about all the horrible things going out in the world"". They also have bingo and they had kids come in to play games with the elders and my mother actually enjoyed that. They kind of force them to get interactions and its helpful. My mother did have a very hard time adjusting and is receiving the highest level of care. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. They accommodate in every way. My mom doesn't like the food but she is a very picky eater but she said the soup is good. She has two aids that she loves, my mother said ""my face lights up when Donna walks into the door and I now the day will be great"". A Place for Mom was wonderful I didn't know where to start when she was declining and than it was like boom I  was so happy I had looked at some places before all of that happened. A Place for Mom was so helpful to me they gave me places, ideas. Also the Promenade told me even if she runs out of money they do take medicaid and not very many areas do that. Martina Donahue told me about other places that would be great as well. But this place has a support group once a month with the social worker and anyone that wants to come.

The atmosphere when you enter the lobby is warm and inviting. While some of the amenities need some updating, it is the people who make the place a great place to live. Some of the meals they prepare are good but if you don't like what is served there is a daily menu to choose something else. They offer activities to the residents but they do not push them to participate which is a good fit for my mom. She is very pleased with her room, one bedroom with a small living area. There is a small courtyard that she enjoys walking around and enjoying the fresh air.

1377787,Anonymous ,4.0, A place where there's an opportunity for quality of life - IF you take advantage of it ,"It's important to note that my loved one doesn't like it here, but he wouldn't like it anywhere.
From his point of view, it'd be a completely different perspective from mine because he doesn't want to be there, but knows he can't be at home. So he's unhappy with a lot of things. For example: the activities - I know they have them and they offer them, but he wont initiate or engage in them. He hasn't experienced them because he doesn't want to, even though we try to encourage him to do so. With the dining experience: they offer round the clock food with different items and three meals a day, but he only goes down for lunch although we try to encourage him to go down more often. But because he won't, we bring him extra food. He's not utilizing a lot of the services, so it's not as bad as what it may seem to be in his eyes. He has troubles speaking up in regards to care services, but from what I've seen they try to do things for him. Another example: he stopped physical therapy because his arms were hurting, but most times you have to build muscle which can result in soreness. So the perspective behind it is that unfortunately my loved one would not be happy anywhere. 

I know that right now every industry & staffing is an issue. What I've seen is a lot of different staff coming and going with Rock Creek and with that, there are some things that haven't been done. It appears to me that they are trying. The staff issue is noticeable, especially in his case. He really liked one lady and so did I, she was fantastic, but she left. There have been a string of people that have left including directors. There's been three directors since November. There are inconsistencies in the staffing area. There's no chef, but the times I've experienced the meals it hasn't been that bad. There have still been inconsistencies, as other residents there have mentioned that it's not the best. My loved one doesn't take full advantage, but some of the menu items and combinations have been a little questionable. For example: they had a July 4th party where they served hot dogs with beans. Staffing I think is an issue as people need more help, but when you have staff coming and going there are going to be inconsistencies. 


Although my loved one doesn't participate, as I walk through I've noticed that there are activities always going on. They have bingo, Uno, a lounge area, a workout area, and a garden. 
The medical at this point is great. He fell one time and had to go to the emergency room; they were right on top of that and made sure he got there. They recognized the fact that he had an infection gong on, so the medical staff seem to be on board and they know what's going on. The other day he made a comment and the head nurse and / or medical director came to him to clarify some things. So I think the medial staff does a pretty good job. 
One thing we were originally told from the Assisted Living Director, who is no longer there, was that a nurse practitioner would be there every month and that does happen; but we were also told that he would be able to see a Doctor once every six months. He hasn't seen a Doctor yet and it's been past that. I'm unsure if that was a misunderstanding or if its supposed to be included - but I think it'd be nice to have a Doctor who could come and speak with the residents. 

Rock Creek Senior Living is a nice facility and it's in a nice area. I picked my loved one's apartment which overlooks a greenery of trees and a creek. Some people don't always have that option, some people face the parking lot, so that aspect of it makes it a pretty nice place. It's located in a nice clean part of town. I also think it's great that they work in conjunction with the hospice service, whether it's immediate or a long-term event. That's a nice feature that the residents don't have to leave the community. The fact that they work hand in hand with a hospice service is a nice surprise for us.

The food is fine, the people are very friendly, everyone's friendly and they had a meet your neighbor evening so he could play the fiddle. He's memory's not that great and he's easily distracted so it's hard for him to get anywhere fast so that was good. It's also nice that he has to go downstairs and walk to food, so that's much better for him.

Nurses and CNAs treat the residents horribly. They do not provide medical equipment to residents like they are supposed to. Management is a joke, all they care about is money. If you’re in the healthcare field and your family member is there they will try to kick them out to cover up the wrong they are doing.  The building doesn’t provide enough supplies for CNAs to properly take care of the residents. A CNA was put in the social worker position with no license and telling everyone she is the social worker. She is not licensed at all and has no idea what she is talking about when she calls family members on the phone. This place needs to be shut down.

1064849,Ms Annonomous ,2.5,Welcome back to the 1950's! ,"Having actually LIVED at Montara Meadows from Feb. 26th until April 1, 2018, I'm definitely in a better position than most to give an opinion about living there 24/7 for an entire month.

First, however, let me tell you that I did meet some really great ladies and men there during my stay and the staff behind the front desk, the cooks and waiters, chefs and food handlers are all just great people and weight on the residents hand and foot.  They are all very nice, warm and friendly and really care about making us all happy at meal times!  They were great to us and I had a lot of fun teasing and having fun joking around with them.  They also prepare really nice food but during my month stay, the kitchen was being remodeled so it made it really hard on everyone, especially the food service staff to get our food to us hot, but all things considered, they did a good job!  Having styrofoam cups and plastic glasses, and then plastic eating utensils, is not what I expected, but it wasn't their fault.  Monday, April 2nd, however, the kitchen was supposed to open back up as normal.  Since I'm not there anymore (thank God) I can only assume things improved for everyone by now! 

The buildings were built a long, long time ago and I'm sure when they were ""new"" they were truly amazing, however...it's now 2018 and other than the main building/clubhouse/dining room, living room, etc., it's still the same as it was decades ago. 

That in itself is bad enough, but when you add the fact that people smoked a lot back then - cigars included - those disgusting odors have lingered and remained in the old, worn out, carpeting that runs throughout the entire hallways and lobbies in each of their buildings.
The stench of all that old smoke is really nasty but to add to that - the overstuffed, outdated, old furniture also is full of that smell too.

The ceilings are all ""popcorn"" and the walls of every hallway and lobby are covered with large, heavy printed framed ""artwork""....like what your great grandma would have hung over her mantle times 100!   

The place has horrible cell reception AND no one has WiFi in their rooms or in their buildings for that matter!

So, if you don't stay in the main building to use your device - good luck trying to reach anyone on the outside!  If you do, however, the call will drop every now and then at the very least.  Most annoying! :(

The fact this entire facility has ONE DESK TOP computer in the main bldg. (2nd floor) - is the only way you're going to be able to reach the outside world - but only between 7:30am and 7:30 pm, 7 days a week!  lf you are on the PC, however, and someone else wants to use it, then you have to stop what you're doing and let them use it.  

The room I had was clean, quiet and faced north on the second floor so at least I had that luxury.  The view out that slider was really nice, but it didn't make up for the fact I had no internet or WiFi in my room - or building.

Of course, pay for internet and altho they provide FREE basic Cox TV cable - you would have to pay more to upgrade that.

All that being said, however, the main reason I was miserable there was because I was given the impression there were other ACTIVE, INDEPENDENT seniors living there, which turned out to not be true.

The average age of the men/women at MM is 85+ and some are in their 90's and one super great lady is 100!  

Therefore, I was the only one much younger than all the rest, so I spent all my time there ALONE - either on the PC or in my room watching TV.  Meals, however, were fun for me because I got to sit with those I really enjoyed being with but that was only 3 times a day. 

Of course, I was able to walk around the neighborhood so I tried that five times the first two weeks, but then decided it wasn't worth the trouble.  The entire area around MM is IMO - an old, dirty, run-down slum.  Even the stores around there were old, nasty and dirty.

Then there was the great ""Geezer Express"" or shuttle.
This bucket of bolts should have been sent to the dump at least 10 yrs ago...and yet, it's still chugging along.  Wait till you ride that thing a few miles...you won't believe how awful it is.  I thought my back was broken the first time we came back from Walmart on Eastern Avenue.

Now, if all of this has you wondering why I wound up there, let me just say this...""it wasn't like it was in the brochure"" and I was grossly mislead on the phone as to the others my age that were living here.  l never did find them or the purple unicorn either for that matter.

Now comes the real kicker!

I paid $2,200 a month for my 550-sq-foot apt with a tiny kitchenette AND on top of that - $2.5K for the homeowners fee.   They make you sign papers that you will pay them $2.2K x 3 months but on top of that the $2.5K HOA fee at the same time!  It's a 90-day lease and can't be broken period! 

Of course, after the 90-day period is over, your rent is month-to-month.  

Well, if you do the math on this, that's a S-load of money for what I just described to you!

A lot of the people at MM should not even be there in the first place.  They should be in either a nursing home or an assisted living facility.  They are NOT active or independent as 90% of them cannot get around without a wheeled walker or an electric scooter.  

Some have dementia, Alzheimer, or are on meds so they can't think clearly but even worse than that, some are extremely handicapped, missing arms or an eye,
so that's really hard to get used to seeing all day every day if you have never been around that before.  It's very sad really, but there have also been some that have gone away in an ambulance never to return. :( 

So, I guess what I'm trying to tell you is BUYER BEWARE!  

If only I had seen the area around Montara in person, I never would have looked twice at it.  It's a fairly nice looking place but it's surrounded by a ghetto in my opinion.  It faces East Tropicana Ave., which is one of the busiest, 4-lane streets in the entire city of Las Vegas, so you can only imagine how scary it is walking near that or living on top of that street!  It did get very quiet after midnight, however...so that was nice.

There is no central a/c in the rooms either.  They have a window unit but it's stuck in the wall and you have no idea what the temp. in your room is, only what you set it on.  That's really not good either, but at least it works.

The other thing which never occurred to me before Montara - and that was - how low to the floor their commodes are!  Maybe back in the 1950's they thought it was a good idea to sit as close to the floor as possible when you used the restroom...but to me that's dreadful!

The older you get, the harder it is to get up and down from a chair - so imagine a commode as low to the floor that you could possible imagine.  That's just insane!

Anyway...the manager is a super nice gal and I will always think fondly of her and several other staff members too, but as a woman who worked in business offices my entire life (1965-2009) I find it very inappropriate for any woman in a ""front desk"" reception position to show as much cleavage as possible without being arrested.  It's just so out of place in a senior facility and yet, this very nice gal - who happens to be about 50 pounds overweight, thinks it's ""cool"" to sit down behind the main lobby counter and show off as much of her huge chest as possible!  

So, remember this....

If you think that spending $3K+ for 90 days is worth all of this I just described...by all means go there and sign up for a room!  The 1-bedrooms are $1.2K/month but the ""studios"" are only $1K per month....just don't forget that you will pay the $2.5K over the first 90-day period in addition to the rent for the ""one time only"" HOA!

I moved out 4/1/18 but MM will still take out another ton of money from my bank account up until 5/26!

Be aware of something else too...

The staff was very reassuring and answered all our concerns about my Mom coming from another state,Florida.The place is very clean and has a lot of activities which was important to us since we feel Mom needs to be active and stimulated.The residents were pleasant and seemed happy.The room accomendations  are spacious and you can bring your own furniture which is a plus to make it more homey looking.Mom has been there for not quite 2 weeks and already she has made friends and she and her room mate are getting along fine,a perfect match.Would recommend to everyone that if they are looking in this area you would not be disappointed with Springfield residence

There are weekly bus trips, shopping excursions and even sightseeing tours. There’s a weekly movie night in a real movie theater- complete with popcorn! Mom enjoys making her own hairdresser appointments and she really likes the weekly opportunities to attend religious services. Story Point has been a wonderful experience for my mom.

There are a few special LNAs and nurses, but most are too burned out and don’t care about the residents.  The building is old and in need of upgrades to their heating and cooling system, phone lines, cable, and internet.  Cooling and heating is a major safety issue and temperatures in the resident rooms can be unsafe.  Food is not great.  A lot of processed and canned food and no fresh fruit or veggies.  Concerns and complaints are not addressed and all you get is lip service.  It is a full time job to advocate for your loved one to receive proper treatment and care.

The staff at Belmont Village near our home made it possible to welcome her for respite care just after New Year's, and after a month or two had passed, Mom became convinced that it was the right place for her to be on a continuing basis.  She lives in a room that she has been allowed to personalize, has made special friends, and receives care that generally addresses her needs without unduly compromising her independence and dignity.  The facility is clean, spacious, and welcoming to residents and family members alike.  I am comforted in knowing that Mom is getting regular meals in a relaxed, open setting, that any changes in her physical or mental condition will be addressed appropriately, and that Belmont's thoughtful leadership will involve us in decision-making.

It was at one point very easy to talk to the department heads and stay on top of my fathers care- there are no department heads (managers) at this location any longer and it takes weeks to get questions answered. There has been no notification for families as to the change of contact personnel- I have sent emails, made phone calls only to be told after a week or more of trying to track someone down that they are no longer employed at Emeritus (now Brookdale).

I keep records for over two years and the facility just got worst.  There was staff that saw what was happening and tried to make changes however they were dismissed.

So it is a corporate issue. 

On top of poor care, they unleased credit collectors on my elderly parents months after discharge - but will not detail what the charges are for. They send statements with no items listed or accounting forms that are confusing and unclear. It feels so predatory. This has caused additional stress that is taking its toll on their health. It is despicable. It does not seem like an ethical company. Do not let nonprofit status fool you.  (Two staff were very very nice - that was it.)

1426996,BB,5.0,Brief stay but great! ,"We had a wonderful experience with Atria Longmeadow Place.  After several years of trying to convince my father in law that he can't and shouldn't be caring for my mother in law with advanced dementia...he finally agreed. We checked out another place and liked Atria much better!  Before we finished the tour, my FIL decided to admit her. He also chose to move into the Assisted living section so he could be there with her. Unfortunately she developed CHF and was admitted to the hospital and has since passed. She was only there for a month. He enjoyed being able to spend time with her but not having to be her caregiver. 
My FIL has decided that he wanted to go back to his home. We tried to convince him otherwise but he has made up his mind. I'm surprised because he liked it there. So, I think that if the two of them had more time there, he would have stayed after she passed. It was all just so new to him that he feels better at home. No fault of anyone's!  We have nothing negative to say at all. Perhaps it was all timing. He did say that he'd wished they had moved in sooner. Anyway, ours is a little different of a story due to the short length of stay. It is not a reflection on Atria or the staff. The short experience was wonderful for all.

There would be times when they wanted to give her medication and I told them she would react adversly to it (I know from my past experiences) but they didn't listen and had to learn the hard way.

1135838,Anonymous,5.0,The Haven--Greenville's Hidden Gem,"My husband has been a resident at the Haven for two years (as of Aug 2019). My family and I have been very satisfied with his care and with their care for us as well. We have been pleased with the staff. The management has always been willing to listen to any concerns we have, which have been few. The food is great and the residents have two options to choose from at each meal. The way this facility is set up is what draws me to it also. There are three identical sections and the residents are free to visit any of them. The resident rooms form the perimeter of each section, so when they exit their room they are immediately in their dining or lounging areas. This promotes more socialization and they have no hallway to walk through to get to a dining room, etc. The place is brightly lit, has great décor, is clean (and smells fresh), and has great pictures on the walls in the hallways between the sections. A nurse practitioner who specializes in dementias comes twice every week and can see any resident who may need some medical attention. A hairdresser is there each Saturday and a podiatrist comes every few months. So the residents are well taken care of.  I call this ""Greenville's hidden gem."" The facility isn't fancy on the outside, but take a look inside and you'll be sold! Most of the bells and whistles in the newer facilities are more for the family members to appreciate than the residents in my opinion anyway.

The biggest reason and this is the most concerning reason, mom is a diabetic and she's on sliding scale and they knew that but they only have nurses there from 9 to 5 therefore they could not honor the sliding scale so they put her on a fixed amount and when we'd take her to the hospital every doctor asked why. They could not handle their medications well, they would say they couldn't give her medications because they didn't have them but they jsut didn't take the time to look for them. We were there 5 days in a row and not one time did any of them say that she was getting low, when I was two and a half hours away they called to say she was low and I had to drive back and fill it. I never authroized them to fill medications, but they did it through theirs and we got charged 900 dollars, if that had been the only problem it would have been fine but i am really concerned about the nursing and the activities that are not age appropriate",2013-08-28T17:11:50.000Z,Memory Care,https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/brighton-gardens-of-columbia-79346,Brighton Gardens of Columbia,"7110 Minstrel Way, Columbia, MD 21045",columbia,maryland,21045,independent-living

They also do not offer specialized dietary help, such as diabetic diets. My grandfather is a diabetic and they put a dessert in front of him every night. It becomes an extremely expensive place to live when you don't want to eat the food and end up eating in your apartment.

1302470,OTR,0.5,Do Not Recommend Memory Care,"As stated in the previous review Oxford Grand, Wichita, did not turn out to be an end of life facility for my loved one either.  Once care needs change the price climbed rapidly.  Soon after your loved one is forced to move because of needing more care that they are unable to provide.  Telling you it is an end of life place is misleading because it is not.  Overall the Memory unit care is below par.  Some of the staff were good and helpful, but the facility was most always short staffed and inept.  Many times high school students were assigned to Memory Care with little or no training.  My loved one was wet many times because of lack of staff to follow the care plan or to even know what the plan was.  There were times my loved one went without being showered for weeks.  The facility is lovely, but not always kept clean in Memory Care. The food was not that great either because it was held in warming trays and not served directly after cooking.  Activities were okay if your loved one can participate.  Otherwise little is geared toward the ones that can't.  You are required to pay for all supplies (except toilet paper) and this included rubber gloves for the staff.  If your loved one needs Memory Care I would definitely look elsewhere.

I really had high hopes since it’s so nicely kept up on the OUTSIDE, but everything has been good until this point unfortunately. I understand previous tenants aren't their fault but its only 2 days before move-in and apartment was in horrendous condition. I doubt their other apartments look like this, but COVID is still here so why isn’t there a deep standard 3-5 day cleaning procedure after each tenant and not a quick last minute one day half cleaning! Isn’t that required especially now with COVID? At this point I don’t even want to move into this specific unit at all after seeing its previous condition with dirt bacteria and so on from previous tenants. There needs to be a very very deep cleaning done that should take several days! Severely disappointed. I doubt their other apartments are like this. Hopefully things get better.

The maintenance and housekeeper have both quit, therefore the facility has become unclean and the rooms are not being cleaned properly. We were promised a shower three times a week but if we are lucky once a week -if we complain. The caregivers are not answering the call lights in a prompt manner in the night.  I don't think there is a good training for them to attend to residents with dementia. The caregivers are expected to do more than caring for the residents, like house keeping,  feeding, cleaning rooms laundry, etc.  The meals are always late and the times have been adjusted to accommodate the schedules of the caregivers.

The good: Clean and no bad smell, much of staff is friendly and helpful, the food was fine, the rehab staff was good and he definitely made progress while he was there.  
The bad: They only give showers / bath twice a week and if you don't speak up you may not even get that.

1140086,Jenny,0.5,Swindled and Pimpef,"Run by greedy, careless administrators that cut corners,[removed]

FL is run on the cheap: frazzled CNAs who staff the desk, help residents, do laundry, administer medication, serve meals and generally run the show with very little oversight. Many are immigrants doing the most difficult work for little pay.

There's an on-site nurse, [name removed] (I'll get to him, later) and he's the only supervising health professional on site. He's there M-F from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm. Should you even utter the words, ""do you know where I can find [name removed]?"" you'll get a dismissive scoff from the staff, ""who knows when he's here!"" When I do find [removed], he's in his office doing paperwork. I have never seen him with a patient.

Care issues that my family member ran into, while being ""take care of"" at Fred Lind:

1. They made no fewer than 6 documented medication errors. I also learned that one of these medications had NEVER been giving during the entire course of my relative's stay at Fred Lind, which was about a year.

2. My family member was twice given morphine, which I suspect (but cannot prove) was given to either incapacitate her to make her more manageable -- even though my family member made it very clear that she does not want to take pain medication.

3. My family member is on oxygen and has pulmonary issues. Aides tipped the diffuser on the oxygen machine, which pumped water into the tubing (can you say pneumonia?) and dripped into her nasal cannula.

4. When my family member developed a skin condition, we had an outside care agency providing wound care. The visiting nurse was very skilled, and recognized that the two wounds needed different treatment. One needed drying (silver powder) and the other needed moisture (antibacterial ointment). Fred Lind reversed the care and ended up [removed]. And of course, charged us an extra $60/month in wound care.

5. My family member fell out of bed and laid on the ground for 8 hours without anyone checking on her. She has arthritis and was unable to raise her arm high enough to reach the emergency cord. [name removed] shifted the blame to my family member, saying that she ""lacks the judgement"" to call for help and blamed her for ""being confused."" However, my family member said she called for help until she was hoarse, and this is an outrageous thing to say to an older person [removed] left on the floor all night.

6. [name removed]. The most anxious, strange individual I have ever met. I'm shocked that he's in geriatrics, because he catastrophizes and says things like the following, all mentioned when my family member was completely healthy, self-transferring and ambulatory:

-""soon she'll be bed-ridden and unable to transfer herself""
-""she's going to be totally incapacitated""
-""she needs a wheelchair and transfers to everything; she can't walk""
-""she weighs [weight] and it's a burden for our staff to help someone so heavy""
Note: my family member is plump, but not exactly the half-ton man!

We experienced a constant barrage of negative messages from [name removed] about how horrible our relative's health was, or how she was on the verge of dying, etc. We'd rush over to FL only to find her eating popcorn and watching the baseball game. Nonetheless, our family member, who uses a walker, had to be pushed everywhere in a wheelchair and wasn't allowed to go anywhere without being accompanied -- for a fee, of course.

When we one day found our relative in bed and unresponsive, after seeing two back-to-back doses of morphine, which our relative always refuses, we had this sinking feeling (which again, we can't prove) that the medication was given to fulfill [name removed] prophecy and bully our relative out of the facility.

7. GREED.

My relative ran out of assets and had to sell her house. As you might imagine, this is a process that takes time, and our family communicated with FL throughout. A week before the house closed, the Director, [removed], sent an [removed] message, accusing our family of elder financial abuse and Medicaid abuse (she's not even Medicaid eligible or on Medicaid). ""That can be the only explanation for your failure to pay, and if you do not remit payment promptly, I will have to report you and have you investigated."" 

I recognize that this is a lame-a** attempt to scare and threaten us into paying, but was harassing, slanderous and downright uncalled for.

If I had more space in this review, I could go on and on. Bottom line: if you're thinking about moving your family member to Fred Lind, think twice!",2015-12-09T06:03:02.000Z,Independent Living,https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/fred-lind-manor-71424,Fred Lind Manor,"1802 17th Ave, Seattle, WA 98122",seattle,washington,98122,independent-living

On one hand the service is pricey but on the other, not easy to find a comprehensive package that would have resulted in such a trustworthy arrangement, which was the overarching criterion. California has stricter rules about payment to caregivers than other states so cost is simply higher but given that as an unavoidable feature, this was still a more viable set up than I could otherwise find.

The staff members at the community are very friendly. We spoke with other individuals living there and they had no complaints, they really have a good track record. They have done a tremendous job during this time with COVID and the few cases they have had, have been completely resolved. We have been very pleased. Before COVID they had a lot of activities, and the event coordinator really did a lot of with the residents. They would take them out to restaurants for lunch on Tuesday's, they also have arts and crafts. They would bring in live entertainment and provide religious services.

1224027,Advise ,1.0,My advice,At first I thought the rehab was a warming place but as time passed I realized that they don’t genuinely care for the patients.  They drop the food in the rooms during breakfast lunch and dinner and honestly don’t even monitor a patient is eating or not.  They drop off the medication the the patients room place it in the table and walk out leaving it up to a patient to take the medication or not.  I witness a patient ask to be place back in her room from the Dayroom because she had a headache an hour passed and this lady was still asking to go to her room.  My family member went in there weighing a sold weight she was healthy she started dropping pounds she wasn’t eating and and the conversation the nutritiononist had with her while I was in the room was “you are over weight so lossing a few pounds won’t harm you”. Is that a correct thing to say? I hate to write this but I just want to suggest that when you admit a family member you continue to monitor them and don’t leave that person unattended if you truely love them.  ,2018-10-31T18:35:01.000Z,Nursing Home,https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/ditmas-park-care-ctr-74936,Ditmas Park Care Ctr,"2107 Ditmas Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11226",brooklyn,new-york,11226,nursing-homes

Honestly, at times when I visit, I have found some of the meal almost inedible.  It's a shame. But, more important than the food is the accessibility of care when the resident's needs change.  Highview states they are unable to begin assisted living services of any level for an independent living resident without plenty of advanced notice.  In our case, it took 4 days notice before assisted living help could be arranged.  That's a real problem if the resident has no family living in the area that can help during those 4 days.  One would think that a facility that specializes in the care of seniors would be able to begin services almost immediately for those living independently there.  As your looking for a place for your loved one, I would strongly suggest you ask the question- ""How quickly can assisted living services begin if the needs of my mother/father change?""

My advice would also have them daily print out a medication list for you.By law they are to inform you of any medication
changes My Mom was put on two that I was never told about. The only way I found out was I could tell she was not acting like herself, so I asked to see what medications she was on and one of them was something she had tried before and had a bad reaction. And I was not called . She was also put on a medication that a Neurologist should diagnose. When I found out I said I wanted her off of it and the physician told the nurses that  she was on it when she came there. I  got her records and that was a lie. They put her on it, I know because I have a copy.So the first time you sense something is wrong just get them out ASAP! I am this persons daughter and I loved the nurses but the management were always in meetings and leave them short staffed quite often. Everywhere you go you will probably run into some aids that are not what they appear to be. And the sad thing is if your loved one has any type of dementia they will take their word over your loved one. So if your gut is telling you that something is not right do not let them talk you into keeping them there, trust me you will regret it!

1262249,Mary,1.0,Not a good experience.,I was there 48 hrs after a hip replacement.  it took 2 hrs for anyone to show up.  Then the first night I got NOOO medications and ended up in severe pain which took 24 hours to recover from. The food is white bread and lots of carbohydrates.  For the first 2 days they did not have a record of me so did not bring me food unless I called and asked for it then said that they had no food orders for me.  It was all a terrible mess.  I wonder how older people who are not able to advocate for themselves survive there.  I would not recommend this place for anyone.

My Grandmother passed away almost four years ago and they continue to say that the unit has not sold. According to the contract they give themselves no timetable to sell the unit within. This not only holds a substantial amount of money for the estate hostage, but it makes it so we are unable to finalize and close out the estate. We were told there was a wait list to get in when my grandmother purchased the apartment and now there hasn't been a single offer in the four years since her death. Very shady business practice.

1175339,Steve Davis,5.0,In praise of Appletree Courts,"Appletree Courts was one of four facilities we visited in the Richardson, TX area after it became apparent that my 91 year old mother could no longer live in her own home safely. She had always been very self-sufficient and hated the idea of giving up her privacy and independence. 

Once we started down the path of transitioning, her priorities were a location near her church, the cleanliness, trustworthiness and friendliness of the staff and environment, and the other amenities and activities that would be available.

They have an interior courtyard with a very nice setting and exterior sidewalks that allow you to move around. There is two major hospitals in the nearby area. The interior of the apartments are very spacious and provide a small refrigerator, microwave and a sink. The living room is big enough to host visitors without having to find a community room; this is a nice feature because you can visit with your family in a private setting. One thing that really sold us on this community for my mom is that they offer restaurant style dining with a menu and it is open from 7 am to 7 pm. The food is really good and they offer a big variety of choices. They have a choice of two dining area one in the front of the community and one in the back, so no matter when you are in the community you have one near you. My mom enjoys this freedom because it gives her the freedom to decide when she wants to eat. So she feels like she is in control of her life rather then a mouse in a maze. They also provide a Primary Care Manager on site once a week so that you can see your physician on site. If you chose to not use them they do offer transportation to and from your appointment.

A podiatrist comes on site regularly and a nurse from another company was arranged to help my mother when she needed dressings changed on a wound. They also will provide transportation to medical appointments with advance notice.
The food is decent, but my mother was eating the soup on a regular basis and had some issues because of the salt content. I would prefer more nutritional information for the residents to help them make better dietary choices.

The entire time she was there, the director, [name removed], never once returned a phone call. Even when another employee sent her a text message with my name and number asking her to call me, she did not. I would go in to find my wife standing by a door, crying and upset, setting off the alarm, and nobody paid any attention to her. That happened more than once. In the time she was there, only once did they come to take her to an activity and that was after I complained. When a group went out for the day, and my wife did not go, she was left behind with no activities, no activity personnel to engage my wife in any way. At least once, my wife did not get a shower or change of clothes for an entire week, and then only when I did it. My wife has dementia. She taken in under assisted living at care level 2. That was my thought, and they agreed she should be a good fit in the assisted living side as apposed to the memory care unit. My main concern was that she be kept engaged. They assured me she would. I did not expect one on one care, but I expected her to be taken care of with some dignity. We were told by many, and this was the second facility she was in, that it could take 3-4 months for people to acclimate. After one month, they wanted to move her to the memory care unit. From $5,300 to $6,800.  One reason cited was that she has not acclimated. ONE MONTH. They said she would be kept engaged in the memory care unit, but that’s what they said about assisted living. I believe they would have told me anything I wanted to hear just to get her in. It was clear to me that it was bait and switch. If they felt she needed memory care and not assisted living, they should have said so, and only been willing to take her in under memory care. They did not want to take the chance of loosing a potential customer. The facility looks nice, but the care in my opinion is criminal. They to not live up to the required standards of care. It is my understanding that [name removed] is still there, and that just amazes me. Several staff members voiced concerns with me when they found out we were leaving, complaining about her. One told me that it was not the first time they had heard to same complaints from other people, and urged me to be specific when I contacted the main office to complain.

1409770,Andi T.,5.0,A Tough Life Transition Made Easy,"One of the biggest challenges of being a daughter is telling your 92-year-old dad that he can't live in his own home anymore. It was very important to find a facility that offered him all of the independence he desired, that was affordable, and provided support for those times when he needed extra help and attention. After looking at several places in Northwest Broward County, we found Garden Plaza at Inverrary, an independent living facility.

[Name removed] in the sales office was an absolute angel in introducing us to the facility and talking us through the process of getting my dad moved in. [Name removed], the director, was incredibly efficient in addressing any bumps along the road.

In fact, every staff member we encountered - from the dining room servers, receptionists, security guard, social director, and of course, administration - have offered superior and responsive customer service.

I know it's early days in my father's stay at Garden Plaza but first impressions are usually spot on. It's a good sign when the staff and residents show genuine affection for each other!

I highly recommend Garden Plaza at Inverrary as a first stop on your search for Independent Living options.

Make sure you ask for [name removed] in sales. He was critical to smoothing out this transition for everybody involved and was an incredible blessing to my family.

She was so gracious, caring, professional, and friendly from the first time we met in our search for help for our very ill aunt up to the time she passed.  We searched all over the Naples area for the best care we could find and found it without the crystal chandeliers and the marble tiles, but with each and every person involved with her care.  The Nurse Manager, [Removed], and the director, [Removed], worked tirelessly with us to provide the best possible situation to provide a beautiful, huge, furnished room for her in an area that would keep her close to the area she could be monitored the best.  They were frequently at the facility long after they should have gone home for the day to make sure everything went as smoothly and efficiently as possible.  The room itself was always very clean and comfortable, and when we stayed with her we witnessed the best in kind and gentle care.  The staff were always quick to respond when help was needed, and always happy to do so.  She enjoyed her meals and we accompanied her at times in the private dining room that is also provided.  When she was too ill to come to eat, the staff worked with her to ensure that her nutritional needs were being met.  She was unable to participate in the activities offered due to her illness, but others seemed to be enjoying themselves greatly.   She was prone to skin tears due to her restless legs and the nurses and doctor were diligent in keeping them well maintained and dressed.  I was amazed at how often she was checked up on during each shift.  She was very happy to be there and it eased our hearts to see that she was so well cared for.  That wasn't the case in the places she was that did have the chandeliers and marble tile.

1220331,Anonymous,4.0,So far so good,"My mother selected Brookdale over several other places because she said during the initial visit that she ""felt comfortable"".  As she was being uprooted from her home of 25+ years this was an important factor to consider.  She has now been a resident for about a month -- anecdotally, her experience to-date has been largely positive.  She seems to be adjusting well and is participating in social activities. She finds the staff warm and accommodating and likes the interaction with her fellow seniors.  But she also likes that she has her own space to retire to.
A few items of note - While not having to prepare her own meals is a big plus, she's still adjusting to more institutionalized food and set meal times.  To be fair, there's nothing wrong with it - but she's an excellent cook, accustomed to eating a more Mediterranean diet. She isn't crazy over the cable channels available -- but I think it's because she's missing her local favorites. 

On the whole though, so far so good. 

Bottom-line - I have no idea if your loved one's experience would be the same as my mom's --  we are very involved in her life and care.  My sister went in to the visit armed with questions. We also spent a lot of time getting her apartment set-up so it felt like home.  All of this - combined with the efforts of the courteous and receptive staff at Brookdale played a part in making her move from a large single family home to a much smaller apartment and the receptive Brookdale community a success.

In short, they want your money.  Clare Bridge verbally promised services and care that weren't in the written contract and, therefore, were not provided.  For instance, they told us light housekeeping was performed on a daily basis, but that service wasn't in the contract, nor was it provided.
Once your loved one has moved in to a facility, please make sure you stay involved as much as possible with their care.  My mother was at Clare Bridge for 10 weeks before she fell and broke her hip.  During that time, members of our family visited with Mom at least 4 times a week.  Every time we arrived, there was something missing from her care - her room smelled like a dirty diaper or her oxygen set-up was not done properly, for instance.

I would definitely recommend putting Glenwood on your list to look at especially if your family member just needs some assistance and cannot make it at home anymore but if you see that your Family member is declining Fast then Glenwood might not be the best fit. Everyone’s situation is different and so I’m not sure how much help my review is but the staff are really friendly and Amy who runs the Facility is great and easy to talk to and is always there to help. Unfortunately our Moms dementia came on so rapidly that once she was in it was within a month we knew we needed to take her to a much more intensive facility.

Whether it's Vaccination access, meds administration, Medicare recs, Brookdale the Heights has demonstrated they have the resident's and their family's interest at heart. What is most important however is how much staff truly cares for residents. My Mom was hospitalized and returned and has been moved to the memory care unit as she's in hospice care now. But almost all staff at her old building have come by to say hello, one member asking me if I wanted pictures he has of her (she's a regular at bingo now). That kind of affection is priceless. The management has been flexible and worked with us as we managed the transition from assisted to hospice. It's been a great support.

We expected the move to be a difficult transition for her. It wasn’t. This is due to Monarch’s whole environment, especially the love and care provided by their phenomenal team. Monarch’s strengths-based approach makes it a true stand-out. The environment is at once social, stimulating, and loving. Our mom absolutely loves being part of Monarch’s community. It’s almost like she is getting to return to her favorite days of college dorm life. The setting is also beautiful. An added bonus is the outstanding food – this is delightful since our mom continues to heartily enjoy this aspect of her life. At Monarch, our mom is the customer, and it shows.

Monarch Cottage has made a huge difference in our lives. Seeing our mom happy at this stage has brought us joy at a time that we weren’t sure was still possible. I only wish she could have moved there sooner!",2021-10-04T20:36:31.000Z,Memory Care,https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/monarch-cottage-1403869,Monarch Cottage,"7630 Fay Ave, La Jolla, CA 92037",san-diego,california,92037,nursing-homes

From the beginning, though, there were disappointments & frustrations. That was over 2 years ago.  The buildings are old and in need of maintenance/repair ie chips/cracks in the walkways that could cause trips or falls, stinky elevators, cheap blinds in the rooms, drawers that are low and hard to pull out, making it hard for the unstable on their feet, dirty carpets in residents' rooms, etc.  There wasn't an orientation for new residents to give them a good start in their new community (ie how laundry service works, when housekeeping will pay them a visit, how to ring for the nurse, how to operate the heater and AC, description of activities and encouragement to participate, how much guests' meals cost, etc.)  A buddy system would have been really helpful the first week.  Then the unreturned calls when we needed various information. The nursing staff was especially friendly & helpful though.  Others in the community often answered questions vaguely.  When the elderly are feeling insecure & overwhelmed about losing their independence & their children are hoping mom or dad is comfortable, content & secure, clear, concise communication & direction provides much-needed support to the family, which we really needed.  That was lacking at GG and at times, we felt very much alone.  And we still do, so we wouldn't recommend GG to others.  Look elsewhere to find a place that runs efficiently, smoothly by a cohesive team that is organized, helpful and friendly.

I like it because it is small, and all of the staff gets to know the residents quickly. When the receptionist, office staff, housekeepers, and even the plant supervisor all know the residents, one can be sure this is a staff who truly cares! There are many activities to participate in, and Judy does a great job of trying to get the residents involved. My mom has only been there a short time but is adapting quite well. The therapy that is in house is wonderful, and with her advanced age, Mom is making great progress. The goal of the entire staff is to keep the residents as independent as possible and let them have dignity. It is wonderful to not have to worry about Mom getting good care and to have the stress removed of having to care for her in my home. I love that there are actual nurses on staff, and they definitely know what is going on with their residents. I love that there is a NP who visits the facility weekly and is in communication with the staff about the residents' health care needs. I truly could not have found a better facility to place Mom, and thanks also go to Liz [Removed] at a Place for Mom, who was able to help me start the search for placement!",2016-07-29T22:12:27.000Z,Memory Care,https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/maristone-of-franklin-1331078,Maristone of Franklin,"347 Riverside Dr, Franklin, TN 37064",franklin,tennessee,37064,nursing-homes

1055298,Son,3.0,Understaffed,Belmont has quite the cuisine but they don't have the care that we needed. Their response time was horrible as far as responding to when we would pull the little pull chains to call a caregiver. We waited as long as 35 minutes one time and other times we waited 20 minutes when my father would be laying on the floor. So that response time was pretty bad and I think it had mostly to do with the lack of caregivers.

1060099,"Robert Hayton, Jr.",5.0,Highly recommended for Assisted Living/Memory Care,"Our father had been living in an Independent Living facility in Woodinville.  Very nice place, but as Dad's memory increasingly faded, we found the need for a more secure and assistive situation.  Dad became a resident in the Memory Unit in what was then Cascade Plaza.  The entire unit had been recently remodeled and had no trace of ""Old Folks Home"" feel and/or smell.  The staff was courteous, respectful and caring.

The Ensign Group purchased Cascade Plaza in 2013, and have done nothing but improve on an already good product:  infrastructure improvements, continued staff training, etc.  We found our experience with the new management group to be exceptional; we were wary at first, but the staff showed their true loving colors and we were very pleased with the transition from Cascade Plaza to Redmond Heights.

We would recommend Redmond Heights to anyone, bar none.  While we did not experience the Assisted Living area of the facility, we had access to it and found it to be similarly well-staffed and cared-for.  

We thank Redmond Heights and all of its wonderful staff for providing Dad an extraordinary end-of-life experience.
